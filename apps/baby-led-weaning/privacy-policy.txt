## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Baby led weaning (“the App”) handles data and clarifies its scope and limitations.

The App is designed with a **strict privacy-by-design approach** and **does not collect any user data**.

---

## No Data Collection – Ever

**The App does not collect, process, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage data.**

Specifically:

- No personal information
- No child data
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No crash reporting
- No cookies
- No third-party SDKs collecting data

**Zero data is collected. Zero data leaves the device.**

---

## No Account, No Identification

The App does **not** require account creation.

As a result:

- Users are not identifiable
- No profiles exist
- No authentication is performed
- No data can be linked to a person or a child

We do not know who uses the App.

---

## Local-Only Storage

Any information entered in the App (such as:

- food exploration logs
- meal notes
- preferences
- educational progress

) is stored **exclusively on the user’s device**.

- Data is never uploaded
- Data is never synchronized
- Data is never backed up to our servers

Deleting the App permanently deletes all data stored by the App.

---

## Data Access, Deletion & Legal Requests

Because the App **does not collect or store any data externally**:

- We cannot access your data
- We cannot retrieve, export, or delete data on request
- We cannot respond to GDPR / CCPA data access or deletion requests, as we do not possess any data

All data control remains solely with the user via their own device.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The App may be used by parents or caregivers for educational purposes related to infant feeding.

- The App does **not** collect data from children
- The App does **not** request information identifying a child
- The App does **not** transmit any information off the device

As no data collection occurs, no children’s personal data is processed.
