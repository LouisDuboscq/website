## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Simple Macro Tracker** (“the App”) handles data and clarifies its scope and limitations.

The App is designed with a **strict privacy-by-design approach** and **does not collect any user data**.

---

## No Data Collection – Ever

**The App does not collect, process, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage data.**

Specifically:

- No personal information
- No food database syncing
- No macro entries transmitted
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No crash reporting
- No cookies
- No third-party SDKs collecting data

All macro entries remain strictly on your device.

**Zero data is collected. Zero data leaves the device.**

---

## No Account, No Identification

The App does **not** require account creation.

As a result:

- Users are not identifiable
- No profiles exist
- No authentication is performed
- No cloud storage is used
- No data can be linked to a person

We do not know who uses the App.

---

## Local-Only Processing

Simple Macro Tracker operates **entirely on-device**.

- All macro entries are stored locally
- All calculations are performed locally
- No synchronization with external servers
- No backup to remote databases
- No external API calls

Uninstalling the App permanently removes all stored data from the device.

---

## Data Access, Deletion & Legal Requests

Because the App **does not collect or store any data externally**:

- We cannot access your macro data
- We cannot retrieve, export, or delete data remotely
- We cannot respond to GDPR / CCPA data access or deletion requests, as we do not possess any user data

All data control remains solely with the user via their own device.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The App is **not specifically designed for children**.

- The App does not knowingly collect data from children
- No personal information is processed

As no data collection occurs, no children’s personal data is stored or transmitted.

---

## Informational Disclaimer

Simple Macro Tracker provides **informational tracking tools only**.

- The App does not provide medical advice
- The App does not replace professional healthcare consultation
- Users are responsible for how they interpret and use their data

Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical or nutritional concerns.

---

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- The App’s creators assume no responsibility for decisions made based on tracked data
- No guarantees are made regarding accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose

Use of the App is at your own discretion.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.

Any changes will be reflected in the App or its store listing.
