## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Simple BMI Calculator** (“the App”) handles data and clarifies its scope and limitations.

The App is designed with a **strict privacy-by-design approach** and **does not collect any user data**.

---

## No Data Collection – Ever

**The App does not collect, process, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage data.**

Specifically:

- No personal information
- No health data collection
- No weight, height, age, or measurement storage outside the device
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No crash reporting
- No cookies
- No third-party SDKs collecting data

**Zero data is collected. Zero data leaves the device.**

---

## No Account, No Identification

The App does **not** require account creation.

As a result:

- Users are not identifiable
- No profiles exist
- No authentication is performed
- No data can be linked to a person

We do not know who uses the App.

---

## Local-Only Processing

Simple BMI Calculator operates **entirely on-device**.

- All calculations (BMI, body fat estimation, BMR, calorie estimation, etc.) are performed locally
- No input data is transmitted
- No information is uploaded
- No synchronization with external servers occurs

Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored App data.

---

## Data Access, Deletion & Legal Requests

Because the App **does not collect or store any data externally**:

- We cannot access your data
- We cannot retrieve, export, or delete data on request
- We cannot respond to GDPR / CCPA data access or deletion requests, as we do not possess any user data

All data control remains solely with the user via their own device.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is **not specifically designed for children**.

- The App does not knowingly collect data from children
- No personal information is processed

As no data collection occurs, no children’s personal data is stored or transmitted.

---

## Informational Disclaimer

Simple BMI Calculator provides **general informational calculations only**.

- Results are statistical estimates
- The App does not provide medical advice
- The App does not replace professional healthcare consultation

Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- The App’s creators assume no responsibility for decisions made based on calculated results
- No guarantees are made regarding accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose

Use of the App is at your own discretion.
