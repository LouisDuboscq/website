## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Ghost - Read without Blue Tick (“the App”) handles data and clarifies its scope and limitations.

The App is designed with a **strict privacy-by-design approach** and **does not collect any user data**.

---

## No Data Collection – Ever

**The App does not collect, process, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage data.**

Specifically:

- No personal information
- No messages content
- No contacts
- No metadata
- No analytics
- No tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No crash reporting
- No cookies
- No third-party SDKs collecting data

**Zero data is collected. Zero data leaves the device.**

---

## No Account, No Identification

The App does **not** require account creation.

As a result:

- Users are not identifiable
- No profiles exist
- No authentication is performed
- No data can be linked to a person

We do not know who uses the App.

---

## Local-Only Processing

Ghost operates **entirely on-device**.

- The App does **not read, store, or transmit message content**
- The App does **not access message history**
- The App does **not intercept or retain communications**

Any functionality provided by the App relies solely on **local device behavior and system-level interactions** permitted by the operating system.

No data is uploaded.

No data is synchronized.

No data is sent to external servers.

Uninstalling the App fully removes all locally stored App data.

---

## Permissions Disclaimer

If the App requests system permissions (such as notification access), these permissions are used **solely to provide the App’s core functionality**.

- Permissions are never used to collect or transmit data
- No information is extracted, logged, or shared
- All processing remains local to the device

Users can revoke permissions at any time via system settings.

---

## Data Access, Deletion & Legal Requests

Because the App **does not collect or store any data externally**:

- We cannot access your data
- We cannot retrieve, export, or delete data on request
- We cannot respond to GDPR / CCPA data access or deletion requests, as we do not possess any data

All data control remains solely with the user via their own device.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is **not designed for children**.

- The App does not target children
- The App does not collect data from children
- The App does not request or process any information identifying a child

As no data collection occurs, no children’s personal data is processed.

## ⚠️ Usage & Responsibility Disclaimer

Ghost does **not modify, interfere with, or guarantee the behavior of third-party messaging services**.

- Read receipts, blue ticks, and visibility indicators are controlled by the respective messaging platforms
- The App does **not bypass security, encryption, or platform safeguards**
- Behavior may vary depending on device, OS version, and third-party apps

You are solely responsible for how you use the App.
